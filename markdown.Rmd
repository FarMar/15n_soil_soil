# Impact of biostimulants on soil nitrogen dynamics

## Overview

These data are from a pot experiment that was conducted to investigate whether biostimulants impact on soil nitrogen (N) cycling and wheat uptake of legume-derived N. Here, we are looking at soluble N and carbon (C) pools over the growth period. These are presented in mg L^-1^ as they are derived from soil solution samples that were collected non-destructively using [Rhizon samplers](https://www.rhizosphere.com/).

## Initial data processing, tidying, etc

First, we need to lead tidyverse, and bring the data into the R environment
```{r load_libraries, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
raw_data <- read_csv("results/raw/15n_soil_sol.csv")

```

We can now see that the data has been successfully loaded into the environment:

```{r raw}
raw
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
